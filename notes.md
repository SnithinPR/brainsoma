# Notes

### TODO

- [ ] Look at validation for Add button - disabled when input is empty then enabled when the input is valid
- [ ] Move the countdown into a toast message which is overlayed, absolute position, fading in and out
- [ ] Try to adapt the sanitise function so that it can accept punctuation like commas
- [ ] Can DOMPurify have a whitelist of acceptable characters?
